This tool provides a web IDE for Grace

To use the editor yourself, copy in a minigrace.js file to the working
tree root. minigrace.js can be generated from a minigrace.git working
tree with:
    make es
and will then be in es/minigrace.js. You will also need to copy in the
corresponding version of background.js (which changes only infrequently).

You will also need to obtain the ACE editor from <http://ace.c9.io/> and put
all of its .js files into the "ace" directory.

If you want to be able to load sample code automatically, copy or symlink the
'sample' directory in your minigrace repository into the root of this one with
the name 'samples'.

You can save user time by precompiling dialects and other dependencies of the
main samples. Any you want to use should be compiled with the same version of
the compiler:
    minigrace --target es -o sniff.js sniff.grace
Alternatively, in the case that you have symlinked in the samples:
    make samples
in the minigrace repository will build the default samples. The sample
programs themselves are loaded from .grace files and do not need
precompilation.

Because of browser security rules, the editor must be served over HTTP for
sample retrieval to work. Either copy it into your web root, or run an
in-place web server such as osws:
    osws -I index.html -m -M .woff application/font-woff \
        -M .json application/json -d .
